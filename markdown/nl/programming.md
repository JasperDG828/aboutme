# Me as a programmer

### The start

It's difficult to tell how I became interested in IT, I might have been born with it. I was always intrigued by to computers. At around 7 years old, my mother taught me how to use Microsoft Word. Now I was able to print coloring sheets from the internet all by myself. Then I started doing it at school too, the teacher let me use her laptop to print for the whole class. (I was in my 2nd year of base-school by then) Aside from Word, I also visited the library to find every book that even had the slightest reference to IT. This was where I picked up Scratch, that one infamous block-based programming language with the organge cat. My teacher caught on to this and recommended me to a have a look at a small startup in Deinze.

### Codefever

That startup was Codefever, they teach programming to children ranging from 8 to 18 years old. In 2016, I started my journey with them in their scratch-course, continuing to Minecraft Education, Basic web development, Python and finally the big league with Ethical Hacking and AI (And they're still expanding). In February of 2023, I started as a class-assistant with Codefever and have been doing it ever since. Codefever will reach their 10th anniversary in 2025.

### My own experience

Aside from Codefever, I started experimenting with code myself too since I didn't have a programming-focused curriculum in secundary school. Using Github, I published my projects to the world. My favorites would be my calculator-programs for TI-84, a few Smartschool-extensions and most of all Bad-Apple, where I used the ubuntu terminal as my canvas for the infamous Bad Apple anime intro. I expanded this project with a version of Gagnam style by PSY.

Though I created these projects by myself, I love working in teams too. Together with a small group, I helped in the development of Classybooks, a library-management tool for elementary schools, as well as Auctionhouse (still in development), an auctioning-platform for the yearly event of our school to raise money for cancer-research. These projects are yet to be published.

If if were to compose a summary of every programming language I have experience in (in some way or another), I would include Python, Javascript (vanilla on frontend and node.js) and basic knowledge in Visual Basic and Batch. I'm planning to look into more low-leven languages like Java or C++.

### Me at Microsoft

<img src="./media/textimages/microsoft.jpg" alt="Me at Microsoft BeLux" width=400/> Finally, I'd like to mention my visit to Microsoft BeLux in Zaventem, Belgium on YOUCA-Action Day. YOUCA-Action Day allows students to perform a their dream-job for 1 day in order to raise money for initiatives trying to improve the world. Together with enthousiastic staff-members, we took a dive into what a day at Microsoft looks like.
