# Me as a musician

### Guitar
When I was around 7 years old, I started taking guitar classes and have been playing the instrument ever since. After 7 years, I started playing acoustic bass guitar in the academy's guitar orchestra. I loved it so much that I bought an electrical bass guitar in 2022 to join Da Capo, the local band.

 A few years ago, I became interested in DJ'ing. We had the opportunity to show our capabilities at school every friday and this resulted in me learning the basics of DJ'ing. Later that year, I started taking lessons at the academy of Lede where DJ Red D taught me the ins and outs of the DJ-profession. Within this period, our group curated events like 'Vooruit met de Geit' and 'Leraar van het jaar'. We even had Belgian eurovision-delegate Gustaph perform our pre-show. 

I haven't entirely broken through just yet, but I am proud of the events I've been able to attend to as a DJ. These include sweet 16's and school events. You can find me under the name DJ BEATOVRFLW.
